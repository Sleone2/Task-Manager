# Expense Tracker 670

# Group 1 - Class 670 - Expense Tracker Group Project

# Summary
Expense tracking is an essential tool for managing personal finances, but many existing applications are designed primarily around monthly tracking periods. This structure often fails to accommodate users who receive bi-weekly paychecks, leaving them with challenges in budgeting and expense monitoring. Current solutions either require manual adjustments to fit a bi-weekly income cycle or lack the flexibility to efficiently track expenses within shorter, non-monthly time frames.
This project aims to develop an Expense Tracker application that integrates with an API for bank data and that allows bi-weekly expense tracking. This is unlike most applications that limit users to monthly periods, our solution will allow our users the option to track, categorize, and visualize their spending on a bi-weekly basis, directly aligning with their income cycles. Key features include customizable tracking periods, automatic categorization of transactions, real-time budget alerts, and visualizations that show spending trends within each bi-weekly period.
By offering bi-weekly tracking, this Expense Tracker will empower users to manage their finances with greater precision, helping them set and stick to budgets that reflect their actual income schedule. This will not only improve their financial planning but also address a significant gap in the current market for expense-tracking tools.
